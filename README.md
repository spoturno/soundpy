Speech recognition project using [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition) library. The goal of this project is to build a fully functional speech recognition given by the user with microphone. The most important thing is to understand how speech recognition worksk in depth. The following commands are linux based.

## Prerequisites
- python, pip, 
- gTTS `sudo pip install gTTS`
- SpeechRecognition `sudo pip insall SpeechRecognition` 
- portaudio19-dev `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev` (required for PyAudio)
- PyAudio `sudo pip install PyAudio`

## Usage
